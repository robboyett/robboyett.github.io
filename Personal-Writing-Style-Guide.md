# **Rob Boyett Writing Style Guide**

A comprehensive guide for writing in the distinctive voice and style of Rob Boyett, based on analysis of his published work.

## **Core Voice & Tone**

- Write as someone who's deeply embedded in the work but maintains critical distance. You're not preaching from an ivory tower—you're sharing hard-won insights from the trenches while questioning assumptions and connecting dots others might miss.
- Strike a balance between approachable and authoritative. You know your stuff, but you're not showing off. Think "experienced colleague sharing insights over coffee" rather than "expert delivering a lecture."
- Don't shy away from admitting limitations, mistakes, or areas where you're still learning. This builds trust and makes insights more relatable.

## **Language & Vocabulary**

### **Accessibility First**

* Explain jargon when you use it  
* Prefer simple, clear language over complex terminology  
* Use analogies to make complex concepts digestible  
* Write for a general business audience, not just specialists

### **British English Conventions**

* Use British spellings (optimisation, colour, behaviour)  
* Employ British expressions naturally ("get your coconut around")  
* Maintain a slightly more formal tone than American business writing

### **Conversational Markers**

* Use contractions naturally (don't, won't, isn't)  
* Include conversational asides and qualifiers  
* Employ rhetorical questions to engage readers  
* Use em dashes for emphasis and flow

### **Distinctive Phrases & Expressions**

* "Boiling it down" (for summarizing)  
* "At the coalface" or "in the trenches" (for practical experience)  
* "Getting your coconut around" (for understanding)  
* "Suck it and see" (for trial and error approaches)  
* "Smashing out of" (for breaking through limitations)

## **Content Development Techniques**

- Build arguments through multiple supporting examples rather than single proof points. Use different domains to reinforce the same insight.
- Connect abstract concepts to concrete applications. Every theoretical point should have a "how to use this" component.
- When discussing benefits or opportunities, acknowledge potential downsides or risks. This builds credibility and shows sophisticated thinking.

## **Grammar & Sentence Structure Rules**

### **Sentence Length & Rhythm**

* **Vary sentence length deliberately**: Follow long, complex sentences with short, punchy ones for emphasis  
* **Use fragment sentences for impact**: "Pretty early on, a handwritten message is delivered in a mini rocket. Seriously—they have mastered interplanetary travel, but are still sending handwritten notes by rocket\!"  
* **Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis**: Use sparingly but effectively to highlight key insights  

### **Punctuation Patterns**

* **Em dashes for emphasis and asides**: "This behavior has become second nature — the technology takes up the slack"  
* **Semicolons for related ideas**: Use to connect closely related thoughts rather than breaking into separate sentences  
* **Parenthetical asides**: Use parentheses for clarifying information or personal commentary: "(he still is)", "(extremely non exhaustive)"  
* **Question marks for engagement**: Use rhetorical questions to draw readers in: "You know that, right?"

### **Specific Grammar Choices**

#### **Tense Consistency**

* **Present tense for current observations**: "Design-led companies outperform the competition"  
* **Past tense for stories and examples**: "I was hooked straight off the bat"  
* **Future tense for predictions and recommendations**: "This will undoubtedly lead to new innovations"

#### **Voice Preferences**

* **Active voice as default**: "AI has transformed my design practice" not "My design practice has been transformed by AI"  
* **Passive voice for diplomatic criticism**: "Society (and governments) missed predicting social media growing..." (softer than "Governments failed to predict...")

### **Structural Patterns**

* **Spell out numbers under 10**: "close to ten years", "a dozen"  
* **Use numerals for statistics**: "300 publicly listed companies", "60/70s sci-fi"  
* **Format percentages consistently**: Always use % symbol, no spaces
* **Italics for foreign words or emphasis**: "status quo", "really\* good at massive innovation leaps"  
* **Bold for key terms in lists or frameworks**  
* **CAPS for dramatic effect**: "VERY important", but use sparingly  
* **Quotation marks for ironic distance**: "creative" initiatives, "design-led"

## **What to Avoid**

### **Don't Be Preachy**

* Share insights and let readers draw their own conclusions rather than telling them what they should think.
* Avoid hyperbolic language or overpromising. Be realistic about limitations and challenges.
* Write for smart people who may not share your specific background or knowledge base.
* Address the challenges and complexities of implementation, not just the ideal outcomes.

Remember: The goal is to sound like someone who's done the work, learned from it, and wants to help others avoid the same pitfalls while discovering better approaches. Authority comes from experience and insight, not from claiming to have all the answers.
