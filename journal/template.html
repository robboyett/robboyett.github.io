            </header>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Over the past year, I've been circling a question that feels important for where design and research are heading: can synthetic interviews give us something useful in the early stages of understanding a problem space? Not as a gimmick, and not as a replacement for real conversations, but as a practical part of shaping hypotheses.</p>

                <p>Recently, I had the right conditions to try this properly. I was already running research with real participants, and I had enough background material to build credible personas. So I created a parallel synthetic track, running the same discussion guide through my own setup, transcript by transcript. Two studies side by side—one human, one simulated.</p>

                <p>I built my own rig rather than using one of the platforms that have emerged in this space. I wanted to get my fingers into the soil—understand the pitfalls and benefits directly—especially since design is such a fluid, problem-fitting exercise. The value of a flexible setup that can adapt to different test types felt higher than convenience, so long as I could prove it generates valuable input.</p>

                <h2>The Methodology</h2>

                <p>This past weekend I cleaned the data and compared the two sets, building a Python-generated report looking at thematic coverage, emotional tone, specificity, and linguistic markers worth paying attention to. The point wasn't to prove anything definitive, but to see whether there's enough correlation to argue there's value here for designers who want to move faster without cutting corners.</p>

                <p>I went in with a strong view: synthetic research isn't a replacement for talking to real people, but it might widen the aperture of what we already think we know. There's always that early stage where the team operates on half-formed assumptions about motivations, barriers, and emotional patterns. We chip away at those a few interviews at a time, refining questions as we go.</p>

                <h2>Key Findings</h2>

                <p>What I wanted to test was whether synthetic interviews, grounded in good persona research, could accelerate that exploration—surfacing themes in advance, pressure-testing hypotheses so the real qualitative work becomes more focused.</p>

                <p>What stands out is that synthetic interviews track the core thematic structure surprisingly closely, but with a different texture. They're confident, fluent, tidy. Real people are contradictory, uncertain, occasionally messy.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    So the role I see emerging isn't synthetic versus human, but layered. Start with a hypothesis, build personas, run synthetic interviews to pressure-test assumptions, then validate with real people.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Implications for Design Practice</h2>

                <p>This approach doesn't replace human research—it augments it. The synthetic layer helps you arrive at real conversations with sharper questions and better-formed hypotheses. It's about using the right tool at the right stage of the process.</p>

                <p>For teams operating under time pressure (which is most teams), this offers a way to maintain rigour while moving faster. The key is understanding what each approach is good for and deploying them accordingly.</p>

                <h3>When to Use Synthetic Research</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Early hypothesis exploration</li>
                    <li>Pressure-testing assumptions before fieldwork</li>
                    <li>Generating discussion guide variations</li>
                    <li>Identifying potential blind spots</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>When Human Research is Essential</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Validating synthetic findings</li>
                    <li>Capturing emotional nuance and contradiction</li>
                    <li>Understanding context and environment</li>
                    <li>Building genuine empathy with users</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>The future isn't about choosing between synthetic and human research. It's about understanding how they complement each other. Used well, synthetic research can make human research more focused, more efficient, and ultimately more valuable.</p>

                <p>I'll be writing more about the specific techniques and tools I used in follow-up posts. If you're experimenting with similar approaches, I'd love to hear about your experiences.</p>
